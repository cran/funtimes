\title{Interval-Based Tails Comparison}
\usage{
tails_i(x0, x1, d = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x0, x1}{vectors of the same length (preferably).
Tail in \code{x1} is compared against the tail in \code{x0}.}

\item{d}{a threshold defining the tail. The threshold is the same for both
\code{x0} and \code{x1}. Default is \code{quantile(x0, probs = 0.99)}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\item{Nk}{vector that tells how many more \code{x1}-values compared with
\code{x0}-values there are within each interval.}
\item{Ck}{vector of the intervals' centers.}
}
\description{
Compare right tails of two sample distributions using
an interval-based approach (IBA);
see \insertCite{Chu_etal_2015_insurance;textual}{funtimes}
and \insertCite{Lyubchich_Gel_2017_insurance;textual}{funtimes}.
}
\details{
Sturges' formula is used to calculate the number of intervals
(\eqn{k}) for \code{x0} \eqn{\ge} \code{d}, then interval width is derived.
The tails, \code{x0} \eqn{\ge} \code{d} and \code{x1} \eqn{\ge} \code{d},
are divided into intervals. The number of \code{x1}-values within each interval
is compared with the number of \code{x0}-values within the same interval
(this difference is reported as \code{Nk}).
}
\examples{
x0 <- rnorm(1000)
x1 <- rt(1000, 5)
tails_i(x0, x1)
