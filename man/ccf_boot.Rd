\title{Cross-Correlation of Autocorrelated Time Series}
\usage{
ccf_boot(
  x,
  y,
  lag.max = NULL,
  plot = c("Pearson", "Spearman", "none"),
  level = 0.95,
  B = 1000,
  smooth = FALSE,
  cl = 1L,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{univariate numeric time-series objects or numeric vectors for which to
compute cross-correlation. Different time attributes in \code{ts} objects are
acknowledged, see Example 2 below.}

\item{lag.max}{maximum lag at which to calculate the cross-correlation. Will be
automatically limited as in \code{\link[stats]{ccf}}.}

\item{plot}{choose whether to plot results for Pearson correlation (default, or use
\code{plot = "Pearson"}), Spearman correlation (use \code{plot = "Spearman"}), or
suppress plotting (use \code{plot = "none"}). Both Pearson's and Spearman's results are
given in the output, regardless of the \code{plot} setting.}

\item{level}{confidence level, from 0 to 1. Default is 0.95, that is, 95\% confidence.}

\item{B}{number of bootstrap simulations to obtain empirical critical values.
Default is 1000.}

\item{smooth}{logical value indicating whether the bootstrap confidence bands
should be smoothed across lags.
Default is \code{FALSE} meaning no smoothing.}

\item{cl}{parameter to specify computer cluster for bootstrapping passed to
the package \code{parallel} (default \code{cl = 1}, means no cluster is used).
Possible values are:
\itemize{
\item cluster object (list) produced by \link[parallel]{makeCluster}.
In this case, a new cluster is not started nor stopped;
\item \code{NULL}. In this case, the function will detect
available cores (see \link[parallel]{detectCores}) and, if there are
multiple cores (\eqn{>1}), a cluster will be started with
\link[parallel]{makeCluster}. If started, the cluster will be stopped
after the computations are finished;
\item positive integer defining the number of cores to start a cluster.
If \code{cl = 1} (default), no attempt to create a cluster will be made.
If \code{cl} > 1, a cluster will be started (using \link[parallel]{makeCluster})
and stopped afterward (using \link[parallel]{stopCluster}).
}}

\item{...}{other parameters passed to the function \code{\link{ARest}} to control
how autoregressive dependencies are estimated. The same set of parameters is used
separately on \code{x} and \code{y}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\item{Lag}{lags for which the following values were obtained.}
\item{r_P}{observed Pearson correlations.}
\item{lower_P, upper_P}{lower and upper confidence bounds (for the confidence level set by \code{level}) for Pearson correlations.}
\item{r_S}{observed Spearman correlations.}
\item{lower_S, upper_S}{lower and upper confidence bounds (for the confidence level set by \code{level}) for Spearman correlations.}
}
\description{
Account for possible autocorrelation of time series when assessing the statistical significance
of their cross-correlation. A sieve bootstrap approach is used to generate multiple copies
of the time series with the same autoregressive dependence, under the null hypothesis of the
two time series under investigation being uncorrelated. The significance of cross-correlation
coefficients is assessed based on the distribution of their bootstrapped counterparts.
Both Pearson and Spearman types of coefficients are obtained, but a plot is provided for
only one type, with significant correlations shown using filled circles (see Examples).
}
\details{
Note that the smoothing of confidence bands is implemented purely for the look.
This smoothing is different from the
smoothing methods that can be applied to adjust bootstrap performance
\insertCite{DeAngelis_Young_1992}{funtimes}.
For correlations close to the significance bounds, the setting of \code{smooth} might
affect the decision on the statistical significance.
In this case, it is recommended to keep \code{smooth = FALSE} and set a higher \code{B}.

# Fix seed for reproducible simulations:
set.seed(1)

# Example 1
# Simulate independent normal time series of same lengths
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
# Default CCF with parametric confidence band
ccf(x, y)
# CCF with bootstrap
tmp <- ccf_boot(x, y)
# One can extract results for both Pearson and Spearman correlations
tmp$rP
tmp$rS

# Example 2
# Simulated ts objects of different lengths and starts (incomplete overlap)
x <- arima.sim(list(order = c(1, 0, 0), ar = 0.5), n = 30)
x <- ts(x, start = 2001)
y <- arima.sim(list(order = c(2, 0, 0), ar = c(0.5, 0.2)), n = 40)
y <- ts(y, start = 2020)
# Show how x and y are aligned
ts.plot(x, y, col = 1:2, lty = 1:2)
# The usual CCF
ccf(x, y)
# CCF with bootstrap confidence intervals
ccf_boot(x, y, plot = "Spearman")
# Notice that only +-7 lags can be calculated in both cases because of the small
# overlap of the time series. If we save these time series as plain vectors, the time
# information would be lost, and the time series will be misaligned.
ccf(as.numeric(x), as.numeric(y))

# Example 3
# Box & Jenkins time series of sales and a leading indicator, see ?BJsales
plot.ts(cbind(BJsales.lead, BJsales))
# Each of the BJ time series looks as having a stochastic linear trend, so apply differences
plot.ts(cbind(diff(BJsales.lead), diff(BJsales)))
# Get cross-correlation of the differenced series
ccf_boot(diff(BJsales.lead), diff(BJsales), plot = "Spearman")
# The leading indicator "stands out" with significant correlations at negative lags,
# showing it can be used to predict the sales 2-3 time steps ahead (that is,
# diff(BJsales.lead) at times t-2 and t-3 is strongly correlated with diff(BJsales) at
# current time t).
